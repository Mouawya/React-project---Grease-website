      <p>
        Are you ready to get the stiffness out of your muscles and joints? To
        start moving and forget all about the corona dip? Dance school Grease in
        Amsterdam is the place to be! Grease is the best dance movie of all
        times and the favorite movie of the founders of this dance school. It's
        how we got into dancing. Besides that, we believe that dancing is the
        way to not only 'grease' your body, but also your mind. Dancing makes
        everybody happy and healthy. It connects people of all different
        cultures and ages. That is why we love it! We offer many different dance
        styles, to make sure everybody can find the dance that suits them and
        keeps them moving. Hope to see you soon in our school!
